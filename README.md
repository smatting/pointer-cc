You add instruments before you are able to use pointer-cc.

1. Take a screenshot of your instrument (VST). Make sure you crop to the exact contents of the window, omit the window bar or borders.
2. Use a paint program to mark all the controls with dots. Choose a color that doesn't occur in the screenshot other. Make sure you note down the color RGB values, e.g. `#ff00ff0` or `R = 255, G = 0, B = 255` for a pink color. For example
